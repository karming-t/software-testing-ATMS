SWE3043 â€“ Software Testing, is a module designed to equip students with the foundations knowledge and skills needed as software tester, and prepare students to sit for professional certification named Certified Tester Foundation Level (CTFL). 
learning outcomes includes basic principles of software testing, test activities, various categories of test design techniques and methods used in black-box, white-box and experience-based testing.

This project was a major part of the module which helped to deepen my practical understanding of how testing documentation is structured and organised while also opening my eyes as to how theoretical concepts learnt in black-box testing is applied in scenarios to create test design specifications and test case specifications.
